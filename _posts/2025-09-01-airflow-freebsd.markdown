Maybe you like FreeBSD? and maybe you also like Apache Airflow? The two can go hand in hand and you can even develop on FreeBSD. The obvious catch (or maybe not so obvious), as of November 2022 you can't leverage Breeze (and Docker). 

Hope is not lost!

COMING SOON

If you’ve questions about any of this I encourage you to use the contact form on my website [here][here].

Cheers! and Happy Hacking!
