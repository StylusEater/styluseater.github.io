Are you struggling with finding good documentation on setting up a basic PostgreSQL cluster? I did too, which is why I put this guide together for you to use and help me improve with your comments. This post assumes you have at basic experience and comfort using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and if you don't then I encourage you to start gaining experience by reading the AWS Getting Started Guide.

COMING SOON

If you’ve questions about any of this I encourage you to use the contact form on my website [here][here].

Cheers! and Happy Hacking!
